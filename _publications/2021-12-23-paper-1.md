<b>Summary:</b> Short-term study-abroad (STSA) programs provide a more
accessible alternative for students who would otherwise not consider
engaging in academic activities overseas. Though improvements in the
levels of intercultural sensitivity and general academic aspects
attained by STSA programs have been previously examined, much less is
known regarding the impact such programs have in the mood of
students. Here, we examined changes in mood state associated with
participation in an STSA program in a group of Japanese university
students. Mood states were assessed using the Profile of Mood States
(POMS), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and the Gratitude
Questionnaire (GQ-6). Results indicated that the POMS mean scores of
Vigor-Activity and SWLS peaked at the time immediately following
participation in the STSA program; moreover, the same scores were
found to be at comparable levels even one month after the end of the
program. These results indicate that participation in STSA programs
can positively influence the mood state of university students,
suggesting that the benefits associated with participation in such
programs extend beyond typically reported improvements in the academic
domain.
