<b>Short summary:</b> We show that fMRI analysis using machine
learning tools are sufficient to distinguish valence (i.e., positive
or negative) of freely retrieved autobiographical memories in a
cross-participant setting. Our methodology uses feature selection
(ReliefF) in combination with boosting methods, both applied directly
to data represented in voxel space. In previous work using the same
data set, Nawa and Ando showed that whole-brain based classification
could achieve above-chance classification accuracy only when both
training and testing data came from the same individual. In a
cross-participant setting, classification results were not
statistically significant. Additionally, on average the classification
accuracy obtained when using ReliefF is substantially higher than
previous results - 81% for the within-participant classification, and
62% for the cross-participant classification. Furthermore, since
features are defined in voxel space, it is possible to show brain maps
indicating the regions of that are most relevant in determining the
results of the classification. Interestingly, the voxels that were
selected using the proposed computational pipeline seem to be
consistent with current neurophysiological theories regarding the
brain regions actively involved in autobiographical memory processes.
