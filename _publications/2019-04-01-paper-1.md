<b>Short summary:</b> Using fMRI and dynamic causal modeling, we
characterized the connections within a relevantq triadic network
(vmPFC-amygdala-hippocampus), and examined how the connections were
modulated by the emotional intensity experienced during an event, and
the valence of the affect evoked when recollecting autobiographical
memories. Results primarily indicated the existence of a vmPFC to
hippocampus effective connectivity during memory
elaboration. Furthermore, the strength of the connectivity increased
when participants relived memories of highly emotionally arousing
events or that elicited stronger positive affect. These results
indicate that the vmPFC drives hippocampal activity during memory
elaboration, and plays a critical role in shaping affective responses
that emanate from AMs.
