We have a new paper examining whether a 12-day online gratitude journaling intervention enhances work engagement in Japanese employees. This study provides experimental evidence that gratitude journaling enhances work engagement by increasing awareness of job resources, integrating gratitude into the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model. The findings suggest that gratitude journaling offers a promising, accessible, and low-cost tool for organizations to foster employee engagement.
