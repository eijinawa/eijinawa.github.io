It's been a while! We have a new paper discussing the relationship between potential intervention targets (such as self-esteem, optimism, and gratitude) and subjective and psychological well-being among Japanese individuals. This topic is significant because it's increasingly evident that positive psychology interventions may not be universally effective, particularly due to cultural variations. Hopefully, these results may orient future attempts (including our own) in developing more effective interventions. The full paper is available <a href = '/publication/2024-03-07-paper-1'>here</a>.
