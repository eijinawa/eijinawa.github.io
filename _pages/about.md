I <a href = "https://cinet.jp/english/people/2014459/">am</a> a senior
researcher at the <a href = "https://cinet.jp/english/">Center for
Information and Neural Networks, aka, CiNet</a> of the <a
href="http://www.nict.go.jp/en/index.html">National Institute of
Information and Communications Technology (NICT)</a>.

<p> My research interests revolve around the indomitable topic of
<i>human <a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion/">emotions</a></i>. How
do they come to be when we recall fond memories of our past? How do they
interact with fundamental cognitive capacities such as attention? What
benefits arise from regularly engaging with positive emotions such as
gratitude, especially when it comes to our well-being? Most
importantly, what are the neurobiological mechanisms driving these
relationships?

<p> To tackle such questions, we employ neuroimaging, psychophysiology,
and online/face-to-face behavioral experiments, using a variety of analytical methods. It is a challenging
journey, but above all, we have fun!
