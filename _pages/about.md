I <a href = "https://cinet.jp/english/people/2014459/">am</a> a senior
researcher in the <a href = "https://cinet.jp/english/">Center for
Information and Neural Networks, aka, CiNet</a> at the <a
href="http://www.nict.go.jp/en/index.html">National Institute of
Information and Communications Technology (NICT)</a>.

<p> My research interests revolve around the indomitable topic of
<i>human <a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion/">emotions</a></i>. How
they come to be when we recall fond memories of past events? How they
relate to fundamental cognitive capacities such as attention? What
benefits are yielded by regularly engaging with specific positive
emotions such as gratitude?

<p> To tackle such questions, we employ neuroimaging, psychophysiology
and online/face-to-face behavioral experiments, in tandem with a host
of different analytical techniques. It is a long and at times rough
journey, but above all, we have fun!
