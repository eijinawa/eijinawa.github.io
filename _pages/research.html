<h3 id="autobiographical-memory">What are the brain mechanisms
underlying our immense capacity to remember episodes from the past?</h3>

How do emotions come to be in such reminiscing moments? How do the brain mechanisms supporting memory processes relate to our ability of imagining the future?

<p> People can recollect memorable events from the past and relive
them in their minds with seemingly very little effort but the brain
mechanisms supporting such essential capacity are far from being
completely understood. One fundamental question that remains to be
answered is what exact functions/computations are performed by the
human hippocampus during the retrieval of episodic/autobiographical
memories.

<p> Towards that goal, we have examined the hierarchical organization
of brain networks involving the hippocampus and other cortical regions
during <a href="/publication/2019-04-01-paper-1">autobiographical
memory construction</a> (aka, memory search) and <a
href="/publication/2020-06-15-paper-1">memory elaboration</a>. Results
showed that regions in the prefrontal cortex, most notably, the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (dlPFC) are highly implicated in such processes, likely driving
hippocampal activity during the stages of memory retrieval.

<h3 id="gratitude">Leveraging the power of positive emotions</h3>

Though no one should be forced to be in a 'positive mood' all the
time, several studies have shown that a nudge towards an increased
awareness to positive emotions experienced in our daily life can
bring benefits to important aspects related to individual
well-being. <img align="right"

<p> We have now tested this idea in two different contexts. <a href="/publication/2021-05-13-paper-1">In our first study</a>, we had college students engage periodically with the
emotion of <i>gratitude</i>. Students were asked to report episodes of
their lives that had made them feel grateful, an activity commonly known as the
<i> gratitude journal</i>. We were particularly interested in
measuring the impact that such an intervention would have in their
academic motivation.

<p> Results showed that students who engaged with the gratitude
journal improved their levels of academic motivation after
two-weeks. Interestingly, there were no signs that the motivation
enhancements had faded away 3 months after the end of the
intervention.

<p> <a href="/publication/2025-10-06-paper-1">More recently</a>, we extended this work by examining whether a similar gratitude journal intervention could enhance work engagement among Japanese employees. In this 12-day online intervention, participants who engaged with the gratitude journal showed significant increases in work engagement, specifically in the absorption dimension. Our analysis revealed that gratitude journaling enhanced awareness of job resources (such as social support), highlighting a potential mechanism through which gratitude influences work engagement.

<p> These findings suggest that gratitude journaling can be a promising, accessible, and low-cost tool for fostering engagement in different life domains. Still, there are many more questions to be clarified than answers; what
are the exact psychological mechanisms underlying such effects? Will such
improvements in academic motivation and work engagement materialize into changes in actual behaviors? What are the long-term effects of such interventions? Most importantly, to what extent can these effects translate into broader impacts on <b>individual well-being</b>?
