<h3 id="autobiographical-memory">What are the mechanisms underlying our immense capacity to
remember episodes from the past?</h3>

How emotions come to be in such reminiscing moments? And how the brain mechanisms supporting memory processes relate to our ability of imagining the future?

<p> People can recollect memorable events from the past and relive
them in their minds with seemingly very little effort but the brain
mechanisms supporting such essential capacity are far from being
understood. One fundamental question that remains to be answered is
what exact functions/computations are performed by the human
hippocampus during the retrieval of episodic/autobiographical
memories.

<p> Towards that goal, we have examined the hierarchical structure in brain
networks linking the hippocampus and other relevant cortical regions
during <a href="/publication/2019-04-01-paper-1">autobiographical
memory construction</a> (aka, memory search) and <a
href="/publication/2020-06-15-paper-1">memory
elaboration</a>. Results showed that regions in the prefrontal cortex,
most notably, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) are highly implicated in such
processes, likely driving hippocampal activity during the stages of
memory retrieval.

<h3 id="gratitude">Leveraging the power of positive emotions</h3>

Though no one should be forced to be in a 'positive mood' all the
time, several studies have shown that a nudge towards an increased
awareness to positive emotions experienced in our in daily life can
bring benefits to various important aspects related to individual
well-being. <img align="right"

<p> <a href="/publication/2021-05-13-paper-1">We recently tested this
idea</a> by having college students engage periodically with the
emotion of <i>gratitude</i>. Students were asked to report episodes of
their lives that had made them feel grateful, an activity commonly known as the
<i> gratitude journal</i>. We were particularly interested in
measuring the impact that such intervention would have in their
academic motivation.


<p> Results showed that students who engaged with the gratitude
journal improved their levels of academic motivation after
two-weeks. Interestingly, there were no signs that the motivation
enhancements had faded away 3 months after the end of the
intervention.

<p> Still, there are many more questions to be clarified than anwers; what
are the exact mechanisms underlying such effects? Will such
improvements in academic motivation materialize into changes in actual
student behavior?
